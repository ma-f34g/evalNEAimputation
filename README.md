# Evaluating Genotype Imputation for Inferring Archaic Tracks in Ancient Humans

This thesis investigates the accuracy of genotype imputation when applied to reconstruct
archaic tracts in ancient human genomes. Through a controlled simulation framework, the
admixture between Neanderthal and early European populations was modelled, enabling
a systematic assessment of the accuracy under various scenarios of DNA fragmentation,
ancestry proportion and sample ages. By comparing the imputed genotypes to the ground
truth, performance metrics were evaluated in order to determine the influence of ancestry
proportions on the obtained results.
